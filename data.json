Ask them to sit with their back straight and feet flat on the floor. Also, make sure the patient has not consumed any caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco for at least 30 minutes before the reading. Position the cuff: Wrap the blood pressure cuff around the upper arm with the bottom edge of the cuff about 1 inch above the bend in the elbow. Make sure the cuff is snug but not too tight. Find the pulse: Use a stethoscope to listen for the pulse in the patient's brachial artery. Place the stethoscope head just below the cuff, over the brachial artery Inflate the cuff: Inflate the cuff by squeezing the rubber bulb until the gauge reads 180-200 mmHg. This is well above the patient's expected systolic pressure. Slowly release the cuff: Release the air in the cuff slowly, at a rate of 2-3 mmHg per second. Listen for the pulse through the stethoscope while releasing the air. Record the readings: Note the point at which the pulse is first heard. This is the systolic pressure. Note the point at which the pulse disappears. This is the diastolic pressure. Record both readings. Repeat: Repeat the reading two more times, waiting at least 1 minute between readings."],
